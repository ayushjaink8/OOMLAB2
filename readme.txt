How to run the program!

**For linux:
run these commands in terminal:
make
./platform


**For windows: (install Mingw first)
run these commands in terminal:
mingw32-make makefile
./platform


****************************************

Brief of what all I have included:

1) There is a proper Login and SignUp functionality!
	* Username behaves as ID ( can't be same for two Publisher and two Subscriber )
	* Database is maintained in subdata.txt for subscribers and pubdata.txt for publishers ( consists Username<space>Password )

2) After Login : a new Platform will be created for you and you will be redirected to either publisher or subscriber object!

3) You can perform the functions given under that object accordingly!

4) Can exit the whole application anytime by pressing Ctrl + C.



****************************************

Main motive of this application was to design the interface and not the proper functionioning.
This is a very scalable application. We can add many more function as per our requirements.
I have just implemented a basic overall foundation.
